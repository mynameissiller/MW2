<p style="color:orange;">History 
Trickshotting was made famous by the Modern Warfare 2 based video game clan, FaZe. However, the act of trickshotting developed naturally when Infinity Ward and other developers of Modern Warfare 2 included the Game/Round Winning Killcam as part of different game types. Players often attempted to embarrass opponent players by killing them in difficult ways such as spinning around first, dubbed a "360". When individual players such as "Zerkaa" began recording impressive killcams and posting on sites such as YouTube, the Modern Warfare community began to follow suit. Although originally trickshotting consisted of long range throwing knife kills, long range no scopes, and kills in which a player turned 360 degrees before killing his opponent, the community of MW2 trickshotters began developing new "trickshots" typically consisting of a combination of spinning, ,reloading their weapon, switching to a secondary weapon, taking out equiptment, and exploiting graphical glitches of the game before killing an opponent.</p><br>
