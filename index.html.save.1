<h1>MW2 is lit!</h1>


<p>Modern Warfare 2 is a game about War and battles that our veterans and active military vets do on occasion in war.
The game involes the foloowing main characters: John "Soap" Mactavish, John Price, Simon "Ghost" Riley, Gary "Roach" Sanderson, Nikolai Joseph Allen etc.
They are all important to the storyline because they either have there own death or have a good thng happen to them ans maybe have a good friend die.
It is what makes thr soryline amazing. The detail of what the characters have on themselves is good and bad stuff such as how they get theyre nick name like Simon "Ghost" Riley did.
